Details:

     The data originally submitted to the UCI ML Dataset on "Human
     Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" has 10299 rows of
     561 columns, along with other data, split into training and rest
     data. The data was acquired from 30 participants going through 6
     activities wearing a smartphone, and accelerometer and gyroscopic
     information was captured for this dataset.

     In this data set, the training and test data were merged, after
     adding activity (code) and subject ids. From this merged data,
     only features (columns) relate to computed means and standard
     deviations were extracted. This resulted in 68 columns of data.
     The activity codes were converted to explicit activity names, and
     the feature names made slightly more readable. The data was grouped
     by subject id and activity name, and for each subject-id-activity
     combination, the average was computed for each column. The data
     was then written out as a text file.

     Since there are 30 subjects and 6 activities for each subject, the
     resulting file has 180 (= 30 * 6) rows and 68 columns.
